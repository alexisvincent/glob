# 位Lambda.Calculus
Lambda Calculus, or The Lambda Calculus (from here on refered to as 位), is a formal system in mathematical logic to describe computation in a general sense by use of function abstraction, application and substitution. It was first described in 1936 by Alonzo Church in-order to formalize the notion of what is 'decidable' or 'computable', and is equivilent to a Turing Machine in that they both describe the same class of computation unit, or function (see Turing 1937).

This essay attemps to give the reader a basic understanding of what 位 is, it's history, how it describes computability, and how it has influenced the field of Computer Science specifically.
